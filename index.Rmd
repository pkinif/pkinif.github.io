Fresh finance graduate with a great passion for Sustainable Development, my cursus in three different universities provided me a strong holistic background in Sustainable Finance. Every day, I am doing research to collect evidence that it does pay to be green and that companies have incentives to adopt sustainable business strategies. To achieve this goal, I have developed strong data analytics skills in learning software environment for statistical computing. My main concern is doing research in a reproducible way so that others may verify my findings and build upon them to further the science and to drive ongoing progress. I am looking for a job opportunity that will improve my skills of data analyst and get me closer from my personal goal: *making the world a greener place*. 

I hope you will enjoy this website and will get to know me!

See you soon,
